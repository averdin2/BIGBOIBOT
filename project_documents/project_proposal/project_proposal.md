## 2.0 PRELIMNARY PROJECT PROPOSAL
### DESCRIPTION
Software development encompasses much more than web applications and mobile applications. Collectively, as a group, we want to delve into another aspect of development: creating bots. A bot is essentially a piece of software that can execute commands. Some of those commands involve replying to messages, or to perform routine tasks. Essentially, when a bot operates, there is little to no human intervention at all, and must be running on a server. Together, we are proposing a multipurpose bot for Discord, a social media platform for gamers, that benefits a user’s overall experience with the application. Currently, there exists tons of Discord bots, such as SpaceBot: a bot that informs Discord users of space information. We plan to add to Discord’s bot environment as well and plan to integrate our bot with outward facing APIs such as Urban Dictionary and more. For a more complete idea, refer to 3.0.


## 3.0 PROJECT PROPOSAL
### DESCRIPTION
For our senior thesis we collectively decided to create a multipurpose bot for Discord: a voice and text chat social media platform tailored for gamers. Our focus will be to enhance the Discord user experience with extra functionality that is not natively available at Discord. Some of the functionality that our bot will provide, but is not limited to, encapsulates interaction with outward facing APIs, and word translations and channel management. For instance, if a Discord conversation involves slang, users can use our bot that uses Urban Dictionary API for quick definitions. For word translations, one of the ideas we have is replacing words with their emoji-counterpart. Furthermore, whoever has access to the bot will also be able to manage permissions in the bot’s assigned server. This provides a comedic element for Discord users and increase discussion morale. We intend to implement this project as a software plugin for Discord in the form of a bot, which Discord allows and verifies. If time permits, we will host the bot on a Heroku server. Our multipurpose bot is robust enough to stand on its own…like a BIG BOI.

### JUSTIFICATION
BIGBOIBOT will be written mostly if not purely in JavaScript and thus will require our knowledge of the language (and node.js) to do so. We will also be using certain Node.js packages during development such as Express.js. Creating various features including features that are barely related to each other will put our vast knowledge of different Computer Science subjects that we have learned through the years. For example, implementing a soundboard will be different from implementing console-controlled user permissions. Nevertheless, we are confident in solving problems; after all, the LMU Computer Science department trains us in that aspect. The project serves as a culmination of the LMU’s Computer Science curriculum. Picking up from CMSI 401, this class again calls for another opportunity to deliver a product for end users. We all had experience with deployment, and this project is another chance to showcase our professional skills. Also, it is important for Computer Science students to always learn because software development covers an extensive field. Taking part in a bot development project is something new for us, but we all have wanted to do this in some way. Now is the perfect time.
